This is a web app made using streamlit.
The app runs a pre-trained classification model (3 stacked models from Pycaret) in the background, and allows you to change settings and make predictions from these settings.

The settings correlate to physical and chemical properties of the wine itself, and the output is a prediction of the wine quality itself.

The model was trained based in the Red Wine Quality dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/red-wine-quality-cortez-et-al-2009 - Final accuracy of the stacked model remains at around 67%. 
The relatively low accuracy is due to the fact that people's tastes in wine vary significantly, and the original data did not account for that. Still, 67% is quite accurate for something so subjective such as taste.

Basically, a Sommelier AI!

For this you will need pycaret, pandas and streamlit.

Once you install all these 3 modules, you can run this from the commandline in the app's folder:
streamlit run wine.py
This will then run the server and open the app directly in your browser.
